======================
Soil moisture monitoring system built with Rust, utilising the [avr-hal](https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal-template) project. For now it only supports the Arduino Uno board, but the code can easily be adapted for other boards with the help of the [avr-hal examples](https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal/tree/main/examples).
## Prerequisites
You need to have the following installed on your system:
### Rust
Install the Rust compiler, this this curl command:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
On Windows use [rustup-init.exe](https://rustup.rs/).

### Avrdude
The installation process for `avrdude` will depend on your OS.

#### Windows
You can download `avr-gcc`, which includes `avrdude`.
You can use the following [guide](https://tinusaur.com/guides/avr-gcc-toolchain/).
After downloading the archive extract it to `C:\Users\Username\Programs\avr8-gnu-toolchain`.
Then, create a ```AVRGCCStart.cmd``` file with this content:
```code
set Path=%Path%;C:\Users\Username\Programs\avr8-gnu-toolchain\bin
set Path=%Path%;C:\Users\Username\Programs\avr8-gnu-toolchain\avr\bin

start cmd
```
After that save it, and then execute the script. From there you can change to where you've cloned the repository and follow the steps after.

#### MacOS
`avrdude` is packaged in a homebrew formula and can be installed with
```
brew install avrdude
```
#### Linux
There should be a `avrdude` package in your distro package manager, for instance for Ubuntu you can use:
```bash
sudo apt-get install avrdude
```
## Usage
Clone this repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:axiomatic-aardvark/oxide-h2o.git
```
And just run the project:
```bash
cargo run
```
